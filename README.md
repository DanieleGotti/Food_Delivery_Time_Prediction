# 🛵 Food Delivery Time Prediction  
### *Statistical Learning Project - 2025*


## 📁 Dataset  
🔗 [**Kaggle: Food Delivery Time Prediction Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denkuznetz/food-delivery-time-prediction/data)

This dataset is designed for predicting food delivery times based on various influencing factors such as distance, weather, traffic conditions, and time of day. It offers a practical and engaging challenge for machine learning practitioners, especially those interested in logistics and operations research.

### 🔍 Key Features:
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Order_ID` | Unique identifier for each order |
| `Distance_km` | Distance of the delivery (in kilometers) |
| `Weather` | Weather conditions: *Clear, Rainy, Snowy, Foggy, Windy* |
| `Traffic_Level` | Traffic intensity: *Low, Medium, High* |
| `Time_of_Day` | Time of the delivery: *Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night* |
| `Vehicle_Type` | Type of delivery vehicle: *Bike, Scooter, Car* |
| `Preparation_Time_min` | Time required to prepare the food (in minutes) |
| `Courier_Experience_yrs` | Experience of the delivery courier (in years) |
| `Delivery_Time_min` | _Target variable_ - Total delivery time (in minutes) |


## 🚀 Goals  
- Explore data and perform feature analysis  
- Build regression models to predict delivery time  
- Evaluate model performance and interpret feature importance  
- Suggest potential improvements for real-world delivery optimization
