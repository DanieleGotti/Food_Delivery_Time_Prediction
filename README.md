# 🛵 Food Delivery Time Prediction  
### *Statistical Learning Project — 2025*

---

## 📊 Overview  
Predicting food delivery times is crucial for enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing logistics. This project explores a real-world dataset to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques. We aim to estimate delivery times based on key contextual features.

---

## 📁 Dataset  
🔗 [**Kaggle: Food Delivery Time Prediction Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denkuznetz/food-delivery-time-prediction/data)

This dataset provides rich information on food delivery scenarios, with features that reflect the complexity of real-world logistics such as weather, traffic, vehicle types, and courier experience.

### 🔍 Key Features:
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Order_ID` | Unique identifier for each order |
| `Distance_km` | Distance of the delivery (in kilometers) |
| `Weather` | Weather conditions: *Clear, Rainy, Snowy, Foggy, Windy* |
| `Traffic_Level` | Traffic intensity: *Low, Medium, High* |
| `Time_of_Day` | Time of the delivery: *Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night* |
| `Vehicle_Type` | Type of delivery vehicle: *Bike, Scooter, Car* |
| `Preparation_Time_min` | Time required to prepare the food (in minutes) |
| `Courier_Experience_yrs` | Experience of the delivery courier (in years) |
| `Delivery_Time_min` | ⏱️ **Target variable** — Total delivery time (in minutes) |
